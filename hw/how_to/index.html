    <h1 id="title">How To Style Curly Hair Using The LOC Method
  <i class="fas fa-arrow-alt-circle-left"></i>

    </h1>

    <p> The LOC Method is my personal favorite when it comes to my hair care routine. LOC stands for Leave-in conditioner, Oil, and Cream. These are the three products you will need to have on hand for this method. Having curly hair requires more focus to be placed on moisturizing. Nourished curls are shiny, defined, and frizz free. Skipping on on these steps could lead to flat, tangled, dry and undefined curls. I had been using all of these products for years before I stumbled upon the Naturally Curly blog post about the LOC method. Finally, my hair routine had been put into a methodological list, and it made a huge difference. Today, I am sharing my LOC Method in a step-by-step guide, so that you can learn how to use this method too.</p>

    <li class="active">
      <h2>Step 1: Rub-a-dub-dub</h2>
      <img src="images/step 1.png" alt="">
      <p> To kick off the LOC Method, start with clean, damp and detangled hair. I like to detangle my hair while I have conditioner in it. It makes the whole process significantly easier and sets me up for the rest of my routine. For the purpose of the LOC Method, your regular cleansing routine should work.</p>
    </li>

      <h2>Step 2: Apply leave-in conditioner (or liquid!)</h2>
      <img src="images/step 2.png" alt="">
      <p>The "L" can stand for either leave-in or liquid. The point is to add moisture that will be sealed in later. Many curly girls use water alone for this step. I used to do that, and it worked okay. Recently, I started using the Carol's Daughter Hair Milk. It's a spray, leave-in conditioner. It is similar to using water, but provides more moisture. This has proved to work much better for my hair.</p>
    </li>

      <h2>Step 3: Oil it up</h2>
      <img src="images/step 3.png" alt="">
      <p> Next, pump some oil onto the palm of your hands and rub them together to warm up and distribute the product. I use the Garnier Fructis Anti-Frizz Serum. I like to evenly distribute a thin layer throughout, focusing on the ends of my hair and avoiding my scalp. I don't have a lot of hair, so I use a quarter sized amount of oil. Adjust the amount of product used depending on the amount of hair you have and its texture. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Step 4: Cream, more specifically, curl creme</h2>
      <img src="images/step 4.png" alt="">
      <p> The last step of the LOC Method is to apply a thick, creamy moisturizer to your hair to seal in the hydration. I use the Agadir Curl Creme for this step. This is a heavy styling cream that brings the strands of hair together to give your curls definition. I distribute this product the same way I do with the oil, except I also scrunch my hair a little afterward. And that's the end of the LOC method. However, I have one more bonus step that I often incorporate in my routine. </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h2>Step 5: Lock in the LOC with gel</h2>
      <img src="images/step 5.png" alt="">
      <p> I guess you could consider this the LOCG Method with this step, but that's not as catchy. Basically, I like to add in a hair gel after the LOC Method, to make my curls last longer. I find that using a gel keeps my curls intact for a day or two longer than the LOC Method alone. For this step I use this crazy looking blue gel from LA Looks. I run a very small amount of this product, about a quarter size for my whole head, through my hair. Make sure not too use too much product, as this would leave your hair feeling crunchy when it dries (unless that's the look you're going for). </p>

      <h2>Step 6: Check out the Naturally Curly post</h2>
      <img src="images/step 6.png" alt="">
      <p> Check out the Naturally Curly website and Youtube channel. I'd like to give credit for this content to naturallycurly.com. They taught me a lot of what I know about the LOC Method and they recommend many exciting and promising products to try out.  </p>
